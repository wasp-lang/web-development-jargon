## API

API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. In the context of web app development API often refers to the communication protocol between a client (front-end) and a server (back-end). Examples of such protocols are SOAP, REST or GraphQL.

Other common usage is when referring to consuming a third-party service from your web page, e.g. invoking a Twitter or Stripe API.
